# can-recycler

A uber alike recycler system.

## Background
To help the new immigrant with life diffculty to get the can eaiser. According to an article, 
it is possible to make over $100/week for recycle the cans.

A simple math, there are 700k population in San Francisco, assume that 10% drink can drink every day.
It is about 70k per day, and which is $7k/day as each can could be redeem in $0.1. 
If we devide the San Francisco to ~10 districts. It would be $700/day. I belive it is more then most 
people can make in the City. Assume there are 10 recycler in each districut, it would be $70/day which is fair. 
With some government support, people can keep bare living in San Francisco.

So this project actually can support maybe about 100 people in the City. 

I might be wrong, but as the project goes, I could get more information.
